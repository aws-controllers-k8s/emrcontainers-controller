              JobTemplateSpec defines the desired state of JobTemplate.

              This entity describes a job template. Job template stores values of StartJobRun
              API request in a template and can be used to start a job run. Job template
              allows two use cases: avoid repeating recurring StartJobRun API request values,
              enforcing certain values in StartJobRun API request.
